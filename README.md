## Description

This is a portfolio project created for
[Head Starter](https://headstarter.co)'s software engineering fellowship.

The primary motivation for the project is to quickly create and
share a comprehensive single paged portfolio to github pages

While this is a quick project I hope to recreate it using the
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) stack

This is Prologue, a simple, single page responsive site template. It features a
clean, minimalistic design and a sticky sidebar with navigation-linked scrolling.
